# [Non-Official] Canal Olympia Web API (scrapper)

This is a non-official scrapper to get movies and theaters data directly from the Canal Olympia's website.


> ## ðŸ‘€ Overview

The full docs is located [here](https://canalolympascrappingapi-production.up.railway.app/docs).
I also use the basics folders structures provided by the following command line :

```
npx ts-express
```

And the code architecture is mainly inspired by the default [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) one.
