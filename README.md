# [Non-Official] Canal Olympia Web API (scrapper)

This is a non-official scrapper to get movies and theaters data directly from the Canal Olympia's website.

> ## ðŸ‘€ Overview

The full docs is located [here](https://canalolympascrappingapi-production.up.railway.app/docs).
I also use the basics folders structures provided by the following command line :

```
npx ts-express
```

And the code architecture is mainly inspired by the default [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) one.


> ### ðŸš€ Deployment

- With npm

  ```shell
  npm install
  npm run start
  ```
- With Docker

```
sudo docker compose up
```

or

```
sudo docker compose up -d
```
